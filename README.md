# Data-Mining-and-Visualization-with-Census-Income-Data
We planned to use census data containing information such as age, education level, sex, marital status, capital gain/loss that year, etc. to predict whether a person is likely to have an income of over $50k or not. Being able to predict whether oneâ€™s customers fall in the high or low-income categories can have a significant impact on what type of goods one would stock up in their shop. Another business question which could be answered is how much the age of a population affects income. We use descriptive analysis, (regularized) logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and A-Rules as well.
